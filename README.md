# cpp_codegen
Trivial C++ code generating and formatting tools written in Haskell.

## gentest

See `test/sample.cpp` and `test/sample.t.cpp` for a preview.

## annotate_bregs
This is a work in progress.

## TODO
* Lookup BREG# values from their deployed headers
* Replace `String` with `Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8`
